The docs have a list \r\n<http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/auth_requirements.html> of which APIs are available.\r\n\r\n\r\nCode layout\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n•\tThe code in this API implementation is organized in MVVM development pattern.\r\n\r\n•\tCode is also structured to fully leverage the object oriented programming techniques.\r\n\r\n•\tJSON and other newer technologies have been used whenever possible.\r\n\r\n## Project status\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n•\tFunctionality to connect to and query Google Genomics is provided.\r\n\r\n•\tThis is an ongoing project. The bioinformatics team at Sequencing LLC (<http://www.sequencing.com>) will continue to add new code and we welcome the public to do the same.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n•\tProvide a strong-type .NET DLL and command line interface to the Google Genomics APIs (to make importing, querying, and other methods more accessible)\r\n\r\n•\tProvide an example of how to use the generated .NET client library.\r\n\r\n## Current status\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis code is getting improvements!\r\n\r\nInstead of being just a simple wrapper around API calls, the code will provide a strong-typed .NET DLL for integrating into your projects and well as command line will start providing additional functionality to make things simpler for callers. \r\n\r\nPlease file feature requests (or email us directly at bioinformatics@sequencing.com) for additional things this awesome command line can do to make your life easier!\r\n\r\nAdding new functionality and to Learn More\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIf you would like to see specific functionality added to this project or if you'd like to learn more about the other exciting projects at Sequencing.com, please contact the Sequencing LLC bioinformatics team by emailing bioinformatics@sequencing.com. Thank you!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
